# Census_income

This project explores the working adult population using census data. It focuses on data cleaning, processing, and performing sanity checks on both continuous and categorical variables. Various relationships between factors such as occupation, education, age, and gender are visualized to derive meaningful insights. The project highlights data-driven observations like pay gaps, workforce distribution across sectors, and work hours per week.
